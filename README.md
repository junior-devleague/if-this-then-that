# if-this-then-that

Human computers!

## Objective 

Select one individual student at a time to come up and be the "programmer" and give a conditional statement to the rest of the class the "computers". The class then has to carry out the commands. Students will take turns being the programmer. Students can speak the command or **pseudo code** the command on the whiteboard. 

## General  
Notes | Expectations
--------|------------
Class Size | 5+
Instructors | 1+
Prep Time | 10 minutes (or 0 minutes with variation)
Activity Time | 15 - 20 minutes
Noise Level | Moderate
Note | Students might have trouble coming up with commands, have a list to the side ready to help them out. 

## The If-Then Statement
If Then is what’s called a conditional statement in programming.  The program queries if one condition exists, then it commands it to do something.  It can be as basic as a True or False question and answer or it can prompt an action.

## If-Then CocONding Game Rules
For each turn, there is one student who is selected to be a Programmer and all the other students are Computers.  The Programmer stands in front of the Computers and gives them his command.  If I ____ (fill in the blank), then you _____ (fill in the blank).  For example, the Programmer below gave the command “If I turn in a circle, Then you turn in a circle.”


Each student will have a turn as the Programmer and you can have as many rounds as you want each round with increasing difficulty.

## Variation
### Difficulty Level 1 – If I Do This, Then You Do This
It’s basically just monkey see, monkey do with some coding language thrown in. The Programmer commands the Computers to do the same thing she does and to stop when she stops.
### Difficulty Level 2 – If I Do This, Then You Do That
You can add the twist that the Computers should do something different than the Programmer, but still start and stop when they do.  This one works the brain because they’ll hear something different than they are seeing.
### Difficulty Level 3 – If I Do This, Then You Do That, Else You Do Something Else
Moving on up the grade levels, you can move on up the coding complexity too with If-Then-Else statements.  For example, the Programmer commands “If I raise my right arm, Then you raise your left arm, Else raise your right foot.”  So if he/she just stands there and does nothing, the Computers should all be raising their right foot.  This gets pretty funny, pretty fast.
### Difficulty Level 4 – If-Then-Else Speed Round with Eliminations
Want to make it really challenging?  Have the Computers “break” and sit down when they don’t follow commands correctly.  The last Computer standing wins.

## Example commands:
- turn around
- Jump once
- jump twice
- jump on right leg
- jump on left leg
- tap right shoulder
- tap left shoulder
- one jumping jax
- two jumping jax
- three jumping jax
- tap your head
- touch your nose
- cover your ears
- raise your right hand
- raise your left hand
- stand on right leg
- stand on left leg
- touch your toes
- lift your arms to the side
- raise your right leg
- raise your left leg
- cover your mouth
- cover your eyes
- two thumbs up
- one thumb up
